Multiple Disease Prediction Application Using Python and Streamlit

# Problem Statement 
People often need to take separate tests or visit different doctors to check for diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease. This can take a lot of time and effort. There is a need for one simple tool that can help users check the chances of having these diseases in one place.

# Solution
This project is a web app made using Python and Streamlit that can predict the chances of diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease based on user inputs like blood pressure, glucose level, and BMI.
It uses machine learning models trained on real medical datasets to make predictions. The app has a clean and easy-to-use interface with a sidebar to switch between diseases. Models are saved using pickle so the app runs fast and smoothly.
